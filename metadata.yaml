description: When a young boy tells Don that he has seen a ghost, Don only laughs.
  There is no such thing as ghosts -- and the little boy probably saw a reflection.
  But to prove the little boy wrong, Don and his friend go to the hill where the boy
  says that the ghost floated towards him and through a rock. Don, however, brings
  his shotgun just in case -- after all, it could have been a wild animal of some
  kind. And when they discover that it wasn't a ghost at all, but something altogether
  different, they must defend themselves from the onslaught of these White Invaders
  -- or face annihilation of everyone they have ever known!
